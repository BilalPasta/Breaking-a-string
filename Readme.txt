INTRODUCTION:
In this project we are breaking a string into two or more parts.
This project is different from conventional breaking string in which
string is break in two parts, however this project is able to break a string
in multiple paths.

EXAMPLE:

For example let say we have a string  AFORAPPLEBFORBALL,
And we want to seperate this string into 6 parts (strings),
at 1,4,9,10,13,17 indexes respestively. 
So we will get 

0-1   Index : A
1-4   Index : FOR
4-9   Index : APPLE
9-10  Index : B
10-13 Index : FOR
13-17 Index : BALL

We will get these 6 strings sepeartely

PROBLEM SOLVING:

This code (project) is able to solve problems that require to extract multiple 
words from a sequence of alphabets.
USES:
It can be effeciently used to seperate words in a sentence without spaces.
It can also be used to pick multiple words/letters from a single sequence of 
character.


HOW TO RUN CODE:

The Code :
1- will ask user to enter number in how many strings(peices) , the original
string had to be break.
2- It will then ask the user indexes of original string , at which string had to 
break.
3- It will then give the result(multiple strings)broked at given indexes 
respectively.
4- It will also give any remaning string in the original list.
